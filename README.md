## Notebooks
The `notebooks` folder contains two Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Model Training.ipynb:** This notebook is used for training the deep learning model for face segmentation and color analysis. It includes code for data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.
2. **Palette Classification.ipynb:** This notebook contains the code for classifying the user's skin, hair, and eye colors into specific color palettes or seasonal color categories. It utilizes the trained model from `Model Training.ipynb` to perform color analysis on user images.
